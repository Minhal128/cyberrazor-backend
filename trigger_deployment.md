# Trigger New Deployment

This file was added to trigger a new Vercel deployment and ensure the authentication endpoints are properly deployed.

## Current Issue
- Authentication endpoints returning 404 errors
- Vercel deployment hasn't picked up latest changes
- Need to force a new deployment

## Solution
1. Commit this file
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
5. Test authentication endpoints

## Expected Result
After deployment, these endpoints should work:
- POST /api/auth/signup
- POST /api/auth/login  
- GET /api/auth/me
- POST /api/auth/logout

## Test Credentials
- Admin: admin@cyberrazor.com / admin123
- User: user@cyberrazor.com / user123
